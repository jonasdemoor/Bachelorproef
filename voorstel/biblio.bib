  Abstract                 = {ZFS has been touted by Sun Microsystems as the
“last word in file systems”. It is a revolutionary file
system with several new features that improve its
reliability, manageability, and performance. ZFS also
contains RAID-Z, an integrated software RAID system
that claims to solve the RAID-5 write hole without
special hardware. While these claims are impressive,
very little information about ZFS and RAID-Z has been
published and no work has been done to verify these
claims. In this work, we investigate RAID-Z and ZFS
by examining the on-disk file layout. We also use a
kernel extension to intercept reads and writes to the
backing store and use this temporal information to
further understand the file system’s behavior. With
these tools, we were able to discover how RAID-Z lays
files out on the disk. We also verified that RAID-Z
both solved the RAID-5 write hole and maintains its
full-stripe write semantics even when the volume is full
or heavily fragmented. Finally, during our testing, we
uncovered serious performance degradation and
erratic behavior in ZFS when the disk is near full and
heavily fragmented.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we describe a new file system that
provides strong data integrity guarantees, simple
administration, and immense capacity. We show
that with a few changes to the traditional high-level
file system architecture — including a redesign of
the interface between the file system and volume
manager, pooled storage, a transactional copy-onwrite
model, and self-validating checksums — we
can eliminate many drawbacks of traditional file
systems. We describe a general-purpose productionquality
file system based on our new architecture,
the Zettabyte File System (ZFS). Our new architecture
reduces implementation complexity, allows new
performance improvements, and provides several
useful new features almost as a side effect.},
